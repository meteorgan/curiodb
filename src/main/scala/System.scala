/**
 * Node is the base actor class that all concrete node types subclass
 * Specifically, there is a concrete Node class for each data type
 * namely: StringNode for strings, HashNode for hashes, etc. There are
 * also some special Node types, such as KeyNode which manages the key
 * space for regular Node actors, and ClientNode which manages a single
 * client connection.
 *
 * The base class here defines the core features of a Node actor,
 * namely:
 *
 *  - Its data value, typed by the type parameter that concrete
 *    subclasses must define.
 *  - Execution of the node's CommandRunner each time a Command is
 *    received.
 *  - Optionally persisting the node's value to disk (snapshotting)
 *    after a command has been handled (second point above), cleaning
 *    up older snapshots, and restoring from a snapshot on startup.
 *
 * Persistence warrants some discussion: we use akka-persistence, but
 * not completely, as event sourcing is not used, and we rely entirely
 * on its snapshotting feature, only ever keeping a single snapshot.
 * This was basically the easiest way to get persistence working.
 * We always store a reference to the last snapshot's meta-data (the
 * lastSnapshot var) so that we can delete old snapshots whenever a
 * new one is saved. As for saving, this is controlled via the config
 * var curiodb.persist-after which is the duration after which a
 * command runs that writes the node's value (described as writable in
 * the commands.conf file). When one of these commands runs, we call
 * save, which will schedule a Persist message back to the node itself.
 * This is based on the assumption that there's no guarantee an
 * actor's recieve and scheduler won't both execute at the exact same
 * time, so we have everything run through receive. The persisting
 * var stores whether persisting has been scheduled, to allow extra
 * save calls to do nothing when persisting has already been scheduled.

/**
 * A KeyNode is a special type of Node in the system. It does not
 * represent any key/value provided by a client, but instead is
 * responsible for managing the keyspace for a subset of keys in its
 * value field, which contains a map of DB names, mapped to keys,
 * mapped to nodes, where each node is represented by a NodeEntry.
 * KeyNode takes on the role of a Node, as there are a variety of
 * commands that logically belong to it.
 *
 * When a ClientNode (the other special type of node, responsble
 * for handling a single client) receives a command for a particular
 * key, the command is first routed to the KeyNode responsible for that
 * key. The KeyNode maps each key to an ActorRef for the key's actual
 * node (StringNode, ListNode, etc), having first created the Node
 * actor at some point (this actually occurs when the key/node doesn't
 * exist and, a command is run that doesn't have a default defined, and
 * writes, as per in commands.conf), and forwards each command onto the
 * Node when received. The routing strategy used is configurable via
 * Akka (actor.deployment./keys.router in application.conf),
 * defaulting to the consistent-hashing-pool router.
 *
 * A KeyNode also handles many commands itself that deal with key
 * management, such as deleting, persisting, and expiring keys.
 * Each NodeEntry instance stores a Option(Long/Cancellable) pair
 * which if expiring, contains the timestamp of when the expiry will
 * occur, and the Cancellable task that will actually run, deleting
 * the node. Deletion of a node (either via expiry or the DEL command)
 * simply sends a message to the Node actor which when received,
 * shuts down the actor, and then removes the key and NodeEntry from
 * the keyspace map.
 *
 * Lastly worthy of discussion is a feature that Redis does not
 * provide, virtual memory, which simply allows a Node to persist
 * its value to disk, and shut down after a period of time (defined by
 * the curiodb.sleep-after duration value in reference.conf). The
 * difference between this occurring and a Node being deleted, is that
 * the key and NodeEntry is kept in the keyspace map. This is also why
 * the ActorRef for each Node in a NodeEntry is an Option - a value of
 * None indicates a sleeping Node. When a command is run against a key
 * mapped to a sleeping Node, a new Node actor is created, which will
 * read its previous value from disk. The idea here is to allow more
 * data to be stored in the system than can fit in memory.

   * keys it recevies, while passing on _MULTI and _EXEC to the Node
   * actors it correctly received keys for - those Node actors should
   * then return a keyCount of 1 in their TransactionAck replies.
