/**
 * Aggregate is the base actor class for aggregate commands. An
 * aggregate command is one that requires data for multiple keys,
 * and therefore must retrieve data from multiple Node actors - this
 * means that normal ClientNode -> KeyNode -> Node flow for a command
 * does not suffice. Each of these command generally have a
 * corresponding Aggregate subclass.
 *
 * The flow of an aggregate command is one where a ClientNode creates
 * a temporary Aggregate actor that lives for the lifecycle of the
 * command being responded to - upon receiving a command, the Aggregate
 * actor breaks the command into the individual key/name/args
 * required per key, and sends these on the normal KeyNode -> Node
 * flow, with the Aggregate actor itself being the Command destination
 * for the response, rather than a ClientNode. The Aggregate actor
 * knows how many responses it requires (usually given by the number of
 * keys/nodes it deals with), and once all nodes have responded, it
 * then constructs the command's Response to send back to the
 * ClientNode.
 *
 * The construction of each Aggregate subclass takes a type parameter
 * specifying the response type it expects back from each Node, as well
 * as a command it will send to each Node it messages.
 *
 * Various aspects of the aggregation flow can be controlled by
 * overriding methods.
